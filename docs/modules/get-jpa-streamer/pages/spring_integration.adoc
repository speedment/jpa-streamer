JPAStreamer comes with first-party support for projects built on top of Spring Boot. Dependency Injection is a fundamental feature of the Spring framework. With this in mind, a JPAStreamer autoconfiguration module can be used to quickly and easily integrate JPAStreamer into your Spring Boot projects.

== Installing the autoconfiguration module

The installation process will differ depending on the build tool you're using. In this guide, Maven and Gradle are covered.

=== Maven
For Maven projects, the following JPAStreamer dependency must be added to the project's pom.xml file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.speedment.jpastreamer.integration.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-jpastreamer-autoconfigure</artifactId>
        <version>${jpa-streamer-version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

=== Gradle
For Gradle projects, the following JPAStreamer dependency must be added to the project's build.gradle file:

[source, groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile "com.speedment.jpastreamer.integration.spring:spring-boot-jpastreamer-autoconfigure:version"
}
----

== Accessing JPAStreamer
Once the required dependencies are installed, you must make JPAStreamer available for injection by explicitly scanning for annotated components. This is done by setting the parameter `scanBasePackages` on the `SpringBootApplication` annotation as follows: 

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages={"com.speedment.jpastreamer"}) 
----

NOTE: If you need to scan multiple base packages, just use a comma separated list e.g. "com.package.A, com.package.B". 

You should now be able to access JPAStreamer using Spring's Dependency Injection system:

[source, java]
----
@Service
public class DummyService {

    @Autowired
    private JPAStreamer jpaStreamer;
}
----

Direct field injection is usually not recommended, it's preferable to inject your dependencies via a constructor:

[source, java]
----
@Service
public class DummyService {

    private final JPAStreamer jpaStreamer;

    @Autowired
    public DummyService(final JPAStreamer jpaStreamer) {
        this.jpaStreamer = jpaStreamer;
    }
}
----

WARNING: JPAStreamer's autoconfiguration relies on a `EntityManagerFactory` bean being present. If you're using Spring Data JPA, this is already handled for you.
